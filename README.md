Now Siemens expects you to create a C type program to call their DLLs but I am most comfortable in python and I am sure there are some out there that are in the same boat.

This is a library which will server as backup / examples for anyone trying to do the same.

Most of these devices and logic blocks will not make sense to someone not familiar our corporate library, but the framework should work with other libraries regardless.

# Features

Generate SCL and LAD logic and import the logic in to TIA Portal.

Generate both Grouped and Ungrouped devices in the "Devices & Network".
