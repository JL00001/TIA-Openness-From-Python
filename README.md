# TIA-Openness-From-Python

Background
TIA Openness is the API that a programer can call to automate most tasks in TIA Portal
Documentation can be found at https://cache.industry.siemens.com/dl/files/533/109798533/att_1069908/v1/TIAPortalOpennessenUS_en-US.pdf

Now Siemens expects you to create a C type program to call their DLLs but I am most comfortable in python and I am sure there are some out there that are in the same boat.

This is a library which will server as backup / examples for anyone trying to do the same.

Features

Generate SCL and LAD logic and import the logic in to TIA Portal

Generate both Grouped and Ungrouped devices in the "Devices & Network"
